Beta scans for pure SU(2) gauge theory
lattice volume : V =8^4
Nconfs = 1000, saved every 10

Plaquettes defined as P_{m,n} = 1/(4V) \sum_x ( 1.0 - Tr U^{m,n}_{\mu\nu}(x) )
where U^{m,n}_{\mu\nu}(x) = product of links around an mxn loop oriented in the \mu\nu plane at site x

``Decimation'' was performed by first choosing a gauge where:

U_\mu(x+e_\mu) = 1 and x%2==0

and then mapping the links U_\mu(x) (x%2==0) to the coarse lattice.

In each case, 20 subsequent sweeps of heat bath (in various forms) were performed


NO DECIMATION

v1 : beta scan; for comparison with known results

FULL DECIMATION 

v2a : beta scan, decimate and refine, then perform multiple sweeps  of heat bath

v2b : beta scan, decimate and refine, then perform multiple sweeps of heat bath, with 2^4-cell edges fixed

v2c : beta scan, decimate and refine, then perform multiple sweeps of heat bath, with 2^4-cell root edges fixed

PARTIAL DECIMATION 

v3a : beta scan; for each thermalized ensemble, performed an ordered initialization of 2^4-cell bulk (leaving 2^4 boundaries fixed, and thermalized), then subsequently perform multiple sweeps of heat bath across entire lattice

v3b : beta scan; for each thermalized ensemble, performed a disordered initialization of 2^4-cell bulk (leaving 2^4 boundaries fixed, and thermalized), then subsequently perform multiple sweeps of heat bath across entire lattice

v3c : beta scan; for each thermalized ensemble, performed an ordered initialization of 2^4-cell bulk (leaving 2^4 boundaries fixed, and thermalized), then subsequently perform multiple sweeps of heat bath within 2^4-cell bulk (leaving thermalized 2^4 boundaries fixed)

v3d : beta scan; for each thermalized ensemble, performed a disordered initialization of 2^4-cell bulk (leaving 2^4 boundaries fixed, and thermalized), then subsequently perform multiple sweeps of heat bath within 2^4-cell bulk (leaving thermalized 2^4 boundaries fixed)

INTERPOLATION

v4a : beta scan; decimated and then refined with interpolation over 2^4-cell boundary; performed several cooling sweeps within the 2^4-cell bulk with large beta to achieve bulk interpolation, then perform multiple sweeps of heat bath

v4b : beta scan; decimated and then refined with interpolation over 2^4-cell boundary; then perform multiple sweeps of heat bath within the 2^4-cell bulk keeping 2^4-cell boundaries held fixed

v5a : beta_coarse scan; configs refined, ans rethermalizes using beta fine determined by one-loop beta-function result: e.g., beta(2a) = beta(a) + 11/(3\pi^2) log(2)
      
v5b : beta_coarse scan; configs refined, and rethermalized using beta fine determined by a matching of P11(coarse) to P22(fine).

v5c : beta_coarse scan; configs refined, and rethermalized using beta fine determined by three-loop beta-function result.

v5d : beta_coarse scan; configs refined, and rethermalized using beta fine determined emperically from v6 scan results, e.g., beta(2a) ~ 0.4286 * beta(a) + 0.9 (approximate leading behavior at strong coupling)

v6a : beta_coarse fixed (1.3); configs refined, and rethermalized scanning in beta fine
v6b : beta_coarse fixed (2.3); configs refined, and rethermalized scanning in beta fine
v6c : beta_coarse fixed (3.3); configs refined, and rethermalized scanning in beta fine
v6d : beta_coarse fixed (4.3); configs refined, and rethermalized scanning in beta fine
v6e : beta_coarse fixed (5.3); configs refined, and rethermalized scanning in beta fine
v6f : beta_coarse fixed (2.5); configs refined, and rethermalized scanning in beta fine
v6g : beta_coarse fixed (2.7); configs refined, and rethermalized scanning in beta fine
v6h : beta_coarse fixed (3.0); configs refined, and rethermalized scanning in beta fine

CANONICAL REFINEMENT

v7a : beta scan; decimated and then refine using "canonical refinement"; then perform multiple sweeps of heat bath
